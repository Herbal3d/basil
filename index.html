    The Basil project is a system of 3D object discovery, manipulation, and display.
    It consists of many modules:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basil Renderer ("BR") which displays 3D objects.
        This is and X11-like render client specialized for 3D objects;
      </li>
      <li>
        Basil Basic User Interface ("BBUI") module that displays a basic virtual
        world-centric user interface;
      </li>
      <li>
        Basil Basic World Manager" ("BBWM") nodule that manages connections to
        virtual worlds to find and instantiate connection modules to various virtual
        world or augmented reality object sources;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    Added to these base modules are connection modules that connect the viewer
    components to object repositories. If the viewer is being used to inhabit a
    virtual world, the repositories would hold the world to view.
    If the viewer is being used for augmented reality, the repositories would
    be locations of objects in the real world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Architecturally, the interface between the modules are defined by their APIs
    and associated protocols.
    This way, the modules can have different implementations, can be distributed
    (run in more than one process or computer), and can evolve independently.
  </p>

  <p>
    The initial implementation of BR, BBUI, and BBWM is in JavaScript to use the
    dynamic linking features and to make the initial viewer widely available.
    BR initially uses WebGL although there is no reason it couldn't be implemented
    in different languages and specialized for specific platforms.
