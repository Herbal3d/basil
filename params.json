{"name":"Basil","tagline":"Modular 3D viewer for virtual worlds and augmented reality","body":"# Basil\r\nThe Basil project is a system of 3D object discovery, manipulation, and display. It consists of many modules:\r\n* Basil Renderer (\"BR\") which displays 3D objects. This is and X11-like render client specialized for 3D objects;\r\n* Basil Basic User Interface (\"BBUI\") module that displays a basic virtual world-centric user interface;\r\n* Basil Basic World Manager\" (\"BBWM\") nodule that manages connections to virtual worlds to find and instantiate connection modules to various virtual world or augmented reality object sources;\r\n\r\nAdded to these base modules are connection modules that connect the viewer components to object repositories. If the viewer is being used to inhabit a virtual world, the repositories would hold the world to view. If the viewer is being used for augmented reality, the repositories would be locations of objects in the real world.\r\n\r\nArchitecturally, the interface between the modules are defined by their APIs and associated protocols. This way, the modules can have different implementations, can be distributed (run in more than one process or computer), and can evolve independently.\r\n\r\nThe initial implementation of BR, BBUI, and BBWM is in JavaScript to use the dynamic linking features and to make the initial viewer widely available. BR initially uses WebGL although there is no reason it couldn't be implemented in different languages and specialized for specific platforms.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
